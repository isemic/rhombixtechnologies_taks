Song Recommendation System Using K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates a song recommendation system built using K-Means clustering to group songs based on their musical features. It then recommends songs within the same cluster, allowing for personalized music recommendations.

Project Overview
The system uses K-Means clustering to group songs based on audio features such as energy, danceability, loudness, and others. After clustering, the system recommends songs from the same group using cosine similarity, which measures how similar songs are to each other in terms of their features.

Key Steps in the Project
Data Loading and Cleaning:

The dataset is loaded from data1.csv, which contains audio features of songs.

Missing values and duplicates are handled to ensure data integrity.

Feature Scaling:

Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data, ensuring each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

K-Means Clustering:

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).

Songs are then grouped into clusters based on their audio features.

PCA for Visualization:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to two components, making it easier to visualize the song clusters.

Song Recommendation System:

Given a song, the system identifies the cluster it belongs to, calculates the cosine similarity between songs within the same cluster, and recommends similar songs.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/isemic/rhombixtechnologies_taks.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd song-recommendation-system
Make sure you have the dataset data1.csv in the same directory, or adjust the path to where the CSV file is located.

Run the main script:

bash
Copy
python song_recommendation.py
For song recommendations, input a song name in the recommend_songs function to get the top similar songs from the same cluster.

Usage Example
If you have a song name (e.g., "Gati Bali") and want to get recommendations, simply call the function recommend_songs:

python
Copy
input_song = "Gati Bali"
recommendations = recommend_songs(input_song, df, num_recommendations=5)
print(f"Recommended songs for '{input_song}':")
print(recommendations)
This will print the top 5 recommended songs that are similar to "Gati Bali".
